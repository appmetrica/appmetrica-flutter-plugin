/// The class contains the starting configuration of the library.
/// Configuration parameters are applied from the moment the library is initialized. You can set:
/// * [apiKey] — application API key;
/// * [advIdentifiersTracking] - (Android only) indicates whether AppMetrica should include advertising identifiers withing its reports.
/// * [anrMonitoring] - whether to capture and send reports about ANRs automatically. The default value is false.
/// * [anrMonitoringTimeout] - the timeout in seconds at which the fact of ANR is recorded.
/// * [appBuildNumber] - build number of application.
/// * [appEnvironment] - application environment to be set after initialization.
/// * [appOpenTrackingEnabled] — indicates automatic collection and sending of information about app open. The default value is true.
/// * [appVersion] — application version;
/// * [crashReporting] — flag for sending information about unhandled exceptions in the platform part of the application. The default value is true;
/// * [customHosts] - custom hosts for startup config.
/// * [dataSendingEnabled] — indicates whether sending statistics is enabled. The default value is true;
/// * [deviceType] - device type based on screen size: phone, tablet, TV.
/// * [dispatchPeriodSeconds] - timeout for sending reports.
/// * [errorEnvironment] — the environment of the application error in the form of a key-value pair. The environment is displayed in the crashes and errors report;
/// * [firstActivationAsUpdate] — flag that determines if the first launch of the application is an update. The default value is false;
///   If the first launch of the application is defined as an update, the installation will not be displayed in reports as a new installation and will not be attributed to partners;
/// * [flutterCrashReporting] — flag for sending information about unhandled exceptions in the flutter code of the application. The default value is true;
/// * [location] — device location information;
/// * [locationTracking] — indicates whether the device location information is being collected and sent.
///   The default value for Android is false, for iOS is true.
/// * [logs] — indicates that logging of the library is enabled. The default value is false;
/// * [maxReportsCount] - maximum buffer size for reports.
/// * [maxReportsInDatabaseCount] — is the maximum number of events that can be stored in the database on the device before being sent to AppMetrica. The default value is 1000.
///   Values in the range [100; 10000] are allowed. Values that do not fall within this interval will be automatically replaced with the value of the nearest interval boundary;
/// * [nativeCrashReporting] — flag for sending information about unhandled exceptions in the application. Exceptions are caused by C++ code in Android;
/// * [preloadInfo] — a [AppMetricaPreloadInfo] object for tracking preinstalled applications;
/// * [revenueAutoTrackingEnabled] — indicates automatic collection and sending of information about In-App purchases. The default value is true.
/// * [sessionTimeout] — session timeout in seconds. The default value is 10 (the minimum allowed value);
/// * [sessionsAutoTrackingEnabled] — indicates automatic collection and sending of information about the sessions of the application user. The default value is true;
/// * [userProfileID] — user profile ID;
